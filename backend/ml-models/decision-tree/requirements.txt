# TalentSol Decision Tree Model Requirements
# IMPORTANT: Version Compatibility Notice for Future Developers

# ⚠️ CRITICAL VERSION CONSTRAINTS ⚠️
# This Decision Tree model was trained with scikit-learn 1.6.1 and has strict version dependencies.
# DO NOT upgrade these versions without retraining the model, as it will cause compatibility errors.

# 🔧 VERIFIED COMPATIBLE VERSIONS (Required for model loading)
scikit-learn==1.6.1    # EXACT VERSION REQUIRED - model trained with this version
joblib==1.3.2          # Compatible with scikit-learn 1.6.1
pandas>=2.0.0          # Current pandas versions are compatible
numpy>=1.24.0          # Current numpy versions are compatible

# 📋 VERSION COMPATIBILITY ISSUE EXPLANATION:
# The trained model contains serialized objects from scikit-learn 1.6.1, specifically:
# - HashingVectorizer from version 1.6.1
# - OneHotEncoder from version 1.6.1
# - _RemainderColsList from sklearn.compose._column_transformer
#
# These objects are not compatible with scikit-learn 1.7.1+ due to internal API changes.
# Attempting to load the model with newer versions will result in:
# "Can't get attribute '_RemainderColsList' on <module 'sklearn.compose._column_transformer'>"

# 🚀 FUTURE UPGRADE PATH:
# To upgrade to scikit-learn 1.7.1 or later:
# 1. Retrain the Decision Tree model with the new scikit-learn version
# 2. Update this requirements.txt file with new version constraints
# 3. Test the retrained model with the TalentSol integration
# 4. Update the model file: best_performing_model_pipeline.joblib

# 📊 PERFORMANCE IMPACT:
# Using scikit-learn 1.6.1 vs 1.7.1+ has minimal performance impact for inference.
# The model prediction accuracy and speed remain the same.

# 🔍 TESTING VERIFICATION:
# Run `python test_model.py` to verify compatibility after any version changes.
# Expected output: "🎉 All tests passed! Your model is ready for TalentSol integration."

# Additional ML libraries (optional - can be upgraded independently)
xgboost>=1.7.0         # Optional: if model uses XGBoost features
nltk>=3.8              # Optional: for advanced text processing
scipy>=1.10.0          # Dependency of scikit-learn
matplotlib>=3.7.0      # Optional: for visualization
seaborn>=0.12.0        # Optional: for visualization
json5>=0.9.0           # Optional: for JSON handling

# 📝 INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS:
# For new environments, install in this order:
# 1. pip install scikit-learn==1.6.1
# 2. pip install joblib==1.3.2
# 3. pip install pandas numpy scipy
# 4. pip install -r requirements.txt (for optional packages)

# 🏷️ LAST UPDATED: August 6, 2025
# 🧪 TESTED WITH: Python 3.13, Windows 11
# ✅ STATUS: Verified working with TalentSol integration
